Hello, I am Memento, your AI assistant. I am here to assist you with your coding project. Please provide me with your instructions.
>Please look into the source code of the application, and write a developer description of its overall architecture, the main folders and their function and any other
facts you think can help a new developer to work on this system. Ignore all of the pdf and rft, files, look at source code only.
The Yelb application is organized into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

1. yelb-ui: This directory contains the user interface of the application. It includes a Dockerfile for containerization and a startup.sh script for initialization.

2. yelb-appserver: This directory contains the application server of Yelb. It includes several Ruby scripts for different functionalities (restaurant_adapter.rb, hostname_adapter.rb, pageviews_adapter.rb, getstats_adapter.rb, yelb-appserver.rb, getvotes_adapter.rb), a Dockerfile, a Gemfile for Ruby dependencies, and a startup.sh script.

3. yelb-db: This directory contains the database of Yelb. It includes a Dockerfile and an initialization script (init-yelb-db.sh).

4. deployments: This directory contains scripts and configurations for different deployment environments. It includes:
   - platformdeployment: Contains subdirectories for different platforms (Docker, Linux, AWS, Kubernetes).
   - localdevelopment: Contains a script for setting up the development environment (setupdevenv.sh).
   - localtest: Contains a docker-compose.yaml file for local testing.

Please note that this is a high-level overview of the application's architecture. For a more detailed understanding, I recommend going through the source code in each directory.
>What is the purpose of the application?
The Yelb application is a simple web application developed by Massimo Re Ferre'. The application's main component is the yelb-appserver.rb, a Ruby-based app that connects to a backend database for persistency.

The application uses several modules for different functionalities:
- Pageviews: Likely used for tracking the number of page views.
- Getvotes: Likely used for retrieving votes from users.
- Restaurant: Likely used for managing restaurant data.
- Hostname: Likely used for managing hostnames.
- Getstats: Likely used for retrieving statistics.
- Restaurantsdbupdate: Likely used for updating the restaurant database.
- Restaurantsdbread: Likely used for reading from the restaurant database.

The application can be configured for different environments (production, test, development) with different settings for each environment.

Please note that this is a high-level overview based on the source code. For a more detailed understanding, I recommend going through the source code in each module.
>what kind of restaurant data is managed by the application?
The Yelb application manages restaurant data in terms of a count associated with each restaurant. This count is stored in a database and can be updated and read.

The restaurant data is managed by several Ruby scripts:
- restaurant_adapter.rb: This script uses the restaurant module to update the count of a specific restaurant.
- restaurant.rb: This script uses the restaurantsdbread and restaurantsdbupdate modules to update and read the count of a specific restaurant.
- restaurantsdbread.rb: This script reads the count of a specific restaurant from the database. It can read from a DynamoDB table or a PostgreSQL database.
- restaurantsdbupdate.rb: This script updates the count of a specific restaurant in the database. It can update a DynamoDB table or a PostgreSQL database.

The count likely represents some form of user interaction with the restaurant in the application, such as votes or visits.
