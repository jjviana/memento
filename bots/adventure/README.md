# Adventure Game Prototype

This prototype demonstrates using Memento to create a simple text-based adventure game with interactive objects.

## Overview

The main components are:

- `Game Master` agent - Handles world state and player interactions
- `Object` agents - Encapsulate object behaviors and properties
- Language model - Drives Game Master and Object agents

To create an adventure:

1. Define `Object` agents for interactive items 
2. Build world state and `describe` prompts
3. Link `Game Master` to invoke `Object` agents 

This allows creating rich worlds with emergent interactions between objects.

## Game Master Agent

The `Game Master` agent acts as the dungeon master in a tabletop RPG game. It:

- Holds global state about object locations, statuses, etc
- Accepts action commands from the player
- Invokes `Object` agents to simulate actions
- Describes the results to the player

For example:

**Player:** `Look at the chair` 

**Master:** Invokes `chair` agent to get description

**Player:** `Sit in chair`

**Master:** Calls `chair` agent to handle `sit` action

So the Master handles world state while delegating object interactions to modular agents.

## Object Agents 

`Object` agents encapsulate the behaviors and properties of game items. Each object gets its own Memento agent with:

- Current state (sitting, open, closed, etc) 
- `describe` prompt to generate descriptions
- Logic to handle supported action commands

For example, a `chest` agent may handle:

**Master:** `describe` 

**Chest:** Returns description based on current open/closed state

**Master:** `open chest`

**Chest:** Changes state, checks for traps, returns new description

This allows creating self-contained interactive objects.

## Example Game

The prototype includes:

- `chair` agent - Supports `sit`, reveals secret note
- `computer` agent - Supports providing the user with a map if the user can unlock the computer using the secret code
- `Game Master` agent - Handles world and invoking `chair` and `computer`

So this shows how Memento can support creating emergent adventure games by combining modular object agents.

The framework is highly extensible - new abilities are added just by building new self-contained `Object` agents.
