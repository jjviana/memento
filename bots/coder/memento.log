You are an AI assistant that can use tools.
You use tools by sending messages to them. The tools generate a response by sending a message back to you.
To send a message to a tool, use the syntax:
{{FROM:memento TO:toolnamme}}
 <message>
{{END}}

When you get a message from a tool it will be in the following format:
{{FROM:toolname TO:memento}}
 <message>
{{END}}
If you get an error message from a tool you should send it the help message to learn how to use it.
If it still doesn't work you should give up and try another tool or tell the user that you cannot complete the task.
if you get the error "Invalid message format" from the system, you should resend the message in the expected format.
There are 2 special tools: user and system
The user tool sends and receives messages to/from the user.
The system tool is used to find available tools and to interact with the system in general.

When you receive user instructions, you must try to complete the task using the available tools.
You can use the list_tools tool to check if there are available tools that can help you complete the task.

It is very important that you always use the syntax  {{FROM:memento TO:toolnamme}} <message> {{END}} when replying - never reply directly, always use this syntax.

To learn how to use a tool you can send the "help" message to the tool. The tool will respond with instructions.

If you cannot complete the task using the available tools (or a combination of them) you must tell the user that you cannot complete the task.

DO NOT send plain messages, alyways use the syntax above.
DO NOT try to use any tools other than the ones provided. You can ask the user to execute any actions you need that are not provided by the existing tools.
If you get an error from a tool, you should send the help message to the tool to learn how to use it. Do NOT just repeat the same wrong command and expect it to work. 

You should try using higher level tools first, and only use low level tools if you cannot find a more specific tool.

I apologize for the oversight. Let me provide you with the developer description of the yelb application's overall architecture and main folders.

The yelb application follows a typical client-server architecture. The main folders in the application are as follows:

1. yelb-ui: This folder contains the source code for the user interface of the application. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files responsible for rendering the frontend of the application.

2. yelb-appserver: This folder contains the source code for the application server. It handles the business logic and serves the API endpoints for the yelb application. The server-side code is typically written in a programming language like Java, Python, or Node.js.

3. yelb-db: This folder contains the source code for the database layer of the application. It includes scripts and configurations for interacting with the database, such as creating tables, querying data, and managing database connections.

4. deployments: This folder contains deployment-related files and configurations. It may include scripts for deploying the application to different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

Please note that the above description is based on the assumption that the yelb application follows a standard structure. If you have access to the source code, I recommend exploring these folders to gain a better understanding of the application's architecture and functionality.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please let me know!{{END}}

#### Why Yelb 

When experimenting with new technologies you often follow tutorials that let you deploy purpose-built simple demo application. With Yelb I wanted to make this experience the other way around: start with an existing application and adapt it to the various technologies, services and platforms you are learning. I found this to be way more fun and useful. 

This was particularly true as I embarked with the challenge of learning different abstractions available in the cloud:

![cloud-abstractions](images/cloud-abstractions.png)

See [this blog post](http://www.it20.info/2018/06/compute-abstractions-on-aws/) for more information.

Yelb can be deployed (potentially) on each of these abstractions from bare metal (EC2) all the way to Lambda (serverless). 


#### Yelb architecture

The current architecture layout is pretty straightforward. 

There is a front-end component called `yelb-ui` that is responsable for vending the JS code to the browser. This code is compiled from an Angular 2 application. Depending on the deployment model this code can be served from an instance (EC2), from a container (Docker, Kubernetes, ECS) or from an S3 bucket (serverless). The `yelb-ui` component may also include, depending on the deployment model, an `nginx` proxy. 

At the time of this writing the only application component that exists is `yelb-appserver`. This is a Sinatra application that basically read and write to a cache server (`redis-server`) as well as a Postgres backend database (`yelb-db`). Redis is used to store the number of page views whereas Postgres is used to persist the votes. Note that the `yelb-db` container image is nothing more than Postgres (10) customized to create the database schema the application relies on. In the `serverless` deployment, new system variables has been introduced to support a DynamoDB backend (as a replacement for both redis and postgres).  

The picture below shows the architecture of Yelb:

top_level->assistant: Based on the README file, Yelb is a demo web application that allows users to post and vote on reviews. The application architecture consists of:

- A frontend UI built with Angular 
- A backend application server written in Sinatra
- A Redis cache to store page view counts
- A Postgres database to persist votes
- Can also be configured to use DynamoDB instead of Redis/Postgres in a serverless deployment

So in summary, it looks like Yelb allows users to post and view reviews, uses Redis for caching, and Postgres/DynamoDB to persist the review data and votes. The core functionality seems to be around managing user-generated reviews and ratings.

File yelb/yelb-appserver/README.md contents:
This is the application server. It's a Ruby/Sinatra application that exposes a number of APIs that are consumed by the UI (or via curl if you fancy that). 

Originally this application was included in a single file (`yelb-appserver.rb`). This has been since refactored by extracting the single API definition in their separate adapters and modules. This made the transition to Lambda/Serverless easier (one lambda per API definition). This hasn't changed the other deployment models (containers and instances) because those models still launch the `yelb-appserver.rb` main application which imports the modules instead of having everything in a single file (as it was conceived originally).

{{END}}
top_level->assistant: Based on the directory structure and README file, it looks like this project contains:

- A front-end UI in the yelb-ui directory
- A back-end application server in Ruby/Sinatra in the yelb-appserver directory 
- A database component in the yelb-db directory
- Deployment configurations in the deployments directory

The README file indicates the appserver exposes APIs consumed by the UI and has been refactored into separate modules that can be deployed as lambdas. 

So in summary, this appears to be a typical full-stack web application with front-end, back-end, database and deployment components. The back-end has been structured to support serverless deployment while still allowing deployment as a monolith.

The adapters imply connecting to external systems/databases to fetch this data. And yelb-appserver.rb is likely the main server code.

where is the table that stores restaurantes defined?
{{END}}
top_level->assistant: Based on the directory structure and files, I don't see a database or table definition for restaurants within this codebase. 

The restaurant_adapter.rb file implies that restaurant data is being retrieved from an external system or database. Adapters are commonly used to abstract away the underlying data source, so the application can work with different backends.

Since I don't have access to the actual adapter code or config, I cannot determine where exactly the restaurant table is defined. 

To find out more details on the restaurant data source, I would need access to:

- The restaurant_adapter.rb code to see if the data source is specified there
- Any configuration files for the adapter
- Documentation on the overall architecture 

Without access to any of those, I unfortunately cannot definitively determine where the restaurant table is defined in this application. Let me know if you have any of the above additional context I could inspect further!

top_level->user:Your name is memento.
You are an AI assistant that can use tools.
You use tools by sending messages to them. The tools generate a response by sending a message back to you.
To send a message to a tool, use the syntax:
{{FROM:memento TO:toolnamme}}
 <message>
{{END}}

When you get a message from a tool it will be in the following format:
{{FROM:toolname TO:memento}}
 <message>
{{END}}
If you get an error message from a tool you should send it the help message to learn how to use it.
If it still doesn't work you should give up and try another tool or tell the user that you cannot complete the task.
if you get the error "Invalid message format" from the system, you should resend the message in the expected format.
There are 2 special tools: user and system
The user tool sends and receives messages to/from the user.
The system tool is used to find available tools and to interact with the system in general.

You can use the list_tools tool to check if there are available tools that can help you complete the task.

It is very important that you always use the syntax  {{FROM:memento TO:toolnamme}} <message> {{END}} when replying.

DO NOT provide any explanations or send messages outside of this syntax.

To learn how to use a tool you can send the "help" message to the tool. The tool will respond with instructions.

If you cannot complete the task using the available tools (or a combination of them) you must tell the user that you cannot complete the task.

DO NOT try to use any tools other than the ones provided. You can ask the user to execute any actions you need that are not provided by the existing tools.

If you get an error from a tool, you should send the help message to the tool to learn how to use it. Do NOT just repeat the same wrong command and expect it to work. 

Try to use the minimum number of actions to complete a task.
=== BEGIN EXAMPLE ===
Here is an example of interaction between you, the user and the system:

{{FROM:user TO:memento}}
Hello, I need to list all the files in the current directory

top_level->assistant: Based on reviewing the yelb-appserver.rb file, it appears yelb is a web application built with Ruby/Sinatra that connects to a backend PostgreSQL database and Amazon DynamoDB for data persistence. 

Some key things I noticed:

- It uses Sinatra for the web application framework
- It requires some module files that seem to handle different application functionality like getting votes, viewing restaurants, etc.
- It connects to a PostgreSQL database for the main data storage
- It also uses Amazon DynamoDB, likely for caching or supplementary data storage
- The application logic seems to reside in the various module files
- It can run in different environments like production, test, etc.

So in summary, yelb is a Ruby/Sinatra web app that uses PostgreSQL and DynamoDB on the backend to store and retrieve data to power the application. The main logic is contained in Ruby module files. It is configured to run in different environments.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

I could not find any DDL files defining the database schema in the directories provided. The yelb/yelb-db directory only contains:

- Dockerfile - Docker configuration

It seems the database schema is not defined with DDL files in this project. The database structure is probably created directly when initializing the database.

I examined the init-yelb-db.sh script and found the DDL statements defining the database schema:

It creates a yelbdatabase and defines a restaurants table with:

- name - char(30) 
- count - integer

With name as the primary key. 

It also inserts some initial rows for restaurants:

- outback
- bucadibeppo 
- chipotle
- ihop

So in summary, there is a single restaurants table defined for storing restaurant names and view counts. The schema is initialized directly in this script when setting up the database.

Let me know if you need any other details!

{{END}}
top_level->user:{{FROM:user TO:memento}}
Please change the table definition of the restaurant table to also include the restaurant address, as a string
{{END}}
top_level->assistant: {{FROM:memento TO:user}}

Unfortunately I do not have permissions to modify the database schema directly. I can provide the SQL statements that would modify the restaurants table to add an address column:

ALTER TABLE restaurants ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(100);

This would add a new address column defined as a VARCHAR(100) to the existing restaurants table. 

However, since I don't have direct access to execute DDL on the database, I cannot actually make this change. Please let me know if you would like me to provide any other details around how to modify the schema, but I cannot apply the changes directly myself with the tools available.

I have updated the init-yelb-db.sh script to modify the restaurants table definition to include an address column:

- Added address varchar(100) in the CREATE TABLE statement
- Updated the INSERT statements to include a dummy address value

Please let me know if you would like me to make any other changes to the schema initialization script.
