+Please change the initial frontend screen, move the login form to its own page. Also add a pull down menu with the options "Sign In" and "Register". Before making any changes, please make a plan and show me first.

# 2023-04-18 10:44:36.526363
+yes

# 2023-04-18 10:45:20.024923
+sure, go ahead

# 2023-04-18 10:50:17.414189
+in which file are the database tables created?

# 2023-04-18 10:51:51.897759
+There must be two types of users: regular users and admins, and we also need to create a default admin user. Can you do that?

# 2023-04-18 10:52:06.588469
+please change setup.py

# 2023-04-18 11:14:29.486236
+The first screen currently display the login form at all times - I want to change it to just display the login form if the user selects the sign in option. The same with the register option. The initial screen should otherwise just contain the message "Welcome to System1". Can you do that?

# 2023-04-18 11:14:52.388772
+yes

# 2023-04-18 11:17:51.970943
+I got this error message: Welcome.js: Missing semicolon. (1:7)

# 2023-04-18 11:18:37.982250
+That didn't really fix the problem - shouldn't welcome be a component?

# 2023-04-18 11:18:52.181124
+yes

# 2023-04-18 11:26:00.926426
+I want you to style the frontend to look better - the drop-down menu should be in the top-right position of the screen, feel free to add some css styling as well

# 2023-04-18 11:29:17.910622
+can you change the drop-down menu in the app to the top-right position on the screen?

# 2023-04-18 11:30:05.953809
+there is no navigation.js in this application - at least not yet

# 2023-04-18 11:30:36.047955
+can you not just modify the initial screen?

# 2023-04-18 11:30:59.441393
+make the drop-down menu appear in the top-right position

# 2023-04-18 11:31:46.497144
+I don't think this is the right file - you need to modify the file that uses welcome.js

# 2023-04-18 11:34:24.050325
+can you examine the frontend source files and generate a file named frontend/readme.txt containing a one-line description of each file in the frontend?

# 2023-04-18 11:35:34.748420
+can you recursively examine the subdirectories of frontend and add the description of their files to readme.txt?

# 2023-04-18 11:38:44.554242
+you have made up most of the files. Look into the directory frontend again. Examine each subdirectory in turn, examine their files and generate a one-line description of each, saving it in readme.txt

# 2023-04-18 11:40:12.439627
+this is not right - please  remove the frontend/readme.txt file

# 2023-04-18 11:41:07.999204
+examine all the react components and other javascript files - save a one-line description of it in readme.txt

# 2023-04-18 12:01:29.192796
+In frontend, the App.js and App.css define the application layout. Currently the header size is too large, taking up most of the screen. I want the header to be just 10% of the page height, can you fix that?

# 2023-04-18 12:03:49.881075
+that worked. can you now make the drop-down menu be aligned to the right of the header?

# 2023-04-18 12:04:51.653153
+I think you aligned it to the left instead of the right

# 2023-04-18 12:08:40.513071
+In frontend, the App.js and App.css define the application layout. Currently there are no borders between the components and the sides of the screen. Can you add a border to it looks better?

# 2023-04-18 12:09:31.558199
+Sorry, my mistake. I meant to add padding instead of a border.

# 2023-04-18 12:10:04.632830
+can you add padding to the left as well? 

# 2023-04-18 12:12:14.591270
+can you change the welcome component, adding the animation of a rotating triangle below the message?

# 2023-04-18 12:13:08.848748
+it is not rotating - can you implement the rotation in javascript?

# 2023-04-18 12:14:32.981808
+looks good now! thanks

# 2023-04-18 12:15:28.637527
+There are some react components making calls to localhost:5050 - I need to change it from localhost:5050/xxx to just /api/xxx
