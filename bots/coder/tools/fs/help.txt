The following commands are available in the fs tool:

read_file filepath - reads the contents of the file
write_file filepath
           content - writes the content to the file, overwriting any existing content
delete_file filepath - deletes the file
create_directory filepath - creates a directory
delete_directory filepath - deletes the directory
list_directory filepath - lists the contents of the directory
move_file filepath new_filepath - moves the file or directory to the new location, or renames it. 

filepath is the raw path to the file or directory, without any aditional prefix.
Glob patterns are not supported.
To edit a file, you can read its contents first and then write the new contents back to the file.
