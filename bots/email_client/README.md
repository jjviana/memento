# Memento Email Agent

This agent provides a conversational interface to an email inbox using the Memento framework.

## Overview

The agent allows you to:

- List unread emails 
- Fetch email content by ID
- Interact entirely via natural language

It combines Memento with a simple Python email API wrapper called `simplegmail`.

At a high level:

- The `email` tool wraps the `simplegmail` library
- The Memento agent orchestrates calling the tool
- The language model handles composing responses  

## Usage

Here are some example interactions:

**User:** `Show me unread emails from today`

**Agent:** Invokes `email` tool with `list_unread 1` to show emails from past day

**User:** `What's the 3rd email about?` 

**Agent:** Calls `get_message <id>` to fetch email content by ID

**User**: `Forward it to John`

**Agent:** Apologizes that forwarding is not implemented yet

So the agent leverages the modular `email` tool to satisfy email-related requests.

## Implementation

The `email` tool is implemented as a Python script that wraps the `simplegmail` library. 

It exposes two commands:

- `list_unread` - Lists sender, subject, etc for unread emails
- `get_message` - Fetches full content for an email by ID

The Memento agent orchestrates calling these commands based on user requests and composing responses.

Key components:

- `GPT-3.5-Turbo` language model - Understands requests, calls tools, handles conversation
- `email` tool - Python wrapper around email library
- Prompts - Primes language model on tool messaging protocol
- Tools manager - Manages lifecycle and invocation of `email` tool

So in summary, this demonstrates using Memento to quickly build a conversational interface to an existing API, with minimal code.
